# Deep Mine Game LUA Prototype
Having made a prototype in Godot, I recreated the basic mechanics in Lua. This prototype has less gameplay mechanics, and is still a work in progress.
Original Godot version can be found [here](https://github.com/romverner/deep_mine_game).

To run, use `love deep_mine_game_lua` or drag the repository folder over the love application on your machine.
